Description: This is a Console Application modeling a ConsoleQuest game. This is a
1 player Role-Playing game where the user has the option to either select a hero or create a
new one embarking on a series of quests. The events are generated at random outlined by a series
of choices, each with their own rewards and actions amidst the process.

How to play:

    1. To choose a hero, select the appropriate corresponding number
    2. After a random event is generated, you either have the option to display the
       inventory, or choose from a series of actions you will undertake.
    3. You are entitled to play in as many adventures as you want
    4. The adventure is over once either specified in the adventure or if the hero has no HP left
    5. The game is over once you specify that you want to quit.


Note: Improvements in the future

    1. When a new hero has been created, this should prompt the user again for a hero
    1. Restructure, organize, clarification on the files
    2. Organize, clarify the logic a bit better
